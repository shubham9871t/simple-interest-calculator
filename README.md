# Simple Interest Calculator

A basic script to calculate simple interest — created as part of our team's transition from SVN to Git. This project is part of an open-source initiative by a micro-finance startup focused on empowering low-income individuals through accessible financial tools.

## 📌 What This Project Does

This script calculates simple interest based on the following formula:

```
Simple Interest = (Principal × Rate × Time) / 100
```

It’s intended for educational and demo purposes, and will serve as a foundational example for our migration to Git-based workflows on GitHub.
